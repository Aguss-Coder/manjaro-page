      <h2>
        Change everything you need
      </h2>
      <p>
        Every person is different and needs an operating system that doesn&apos;t try 
        to enforce a specific workflow, visual style or certain programs. Manjaro 
        comes with default settings, that we believe are helpful to most users. But as 
        with most Linux distributions, you still have every option to configure, change, 
        remove or replace whatever you like. Most of these options are directly available 
        via an easy to use configuration program.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class='div-container_2'>
      <h2>
        Control Your PC
      </h2>
      <p>
        As like many other Linux distributions, we believe that privacy, security 
        and keeping control are among the most valuable things for a user. We have 
        included some clever tools to accomplish everything needed to make room for 
        actual work, entertainment and relaxation. But you, the user, will always be in 
        control of your own computer. It&apos;s your hardware and your operating system.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class='div-container_3'>
      <h2>
        Update when you want
      </h2>
      <p>
        When updates are available Manjaro will just show an unobtrusive notification. 
        If you have important work to do, are currently in a ranked game or watching a 
        movie, you can just hide it with one click. “Not now” for us still means that you don&apos;t 
        have time and don&apos;t want to update right now. There are no hidden downloads or automatic 
        restarts. Manjaro does exactly what you want.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class='div-container_4'>
      <h2>
        Your data not ours
      </h2>
      <p>
        Manjaro does not send any data to anybody. Why should it? It&apos;s your data 
        and you decide what you want to do with it. You can decide if you want to 
        use services that finance themselves with the data you generate. But you also 
        can decide to secure, hide and protect your data and use open source software 
        which is directly available in Manjaro&apos;s repositories and has been additionally 
        checked by the package maintainer.
